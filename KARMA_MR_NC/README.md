Supplementary code for the paper "Evaluation of Circulating Plasma Proteins in Breast Cancer - a Mendelian Randomization Analysis"

This repository contains the code to perform the following analyzes

-   Evaluation of detectability in Olink data
-   Evaluation of NPX ranges in Olink data
-   Association between plasma protein levels and baseline characteristics

NOTE: For reasons of privacy, the clinical variables can not be shared. Instead, the clinical variables in this example data are randomly generated. The associations to baseline characteristics can therefore not be replicated using this data
